# Introduction
This project was created as part of my portfolio to proactively address gaps in my current technical skill set. It is a partial clone of [My Muscle Chef](https://www.mymusclechef.com/), built to demonstrate my ability to work with modern frontend technologies and integrate with external APIs.

In particular, this project focuses on:
- Practicing React with TypeScript using the Next.js framework  
- Exploring GraphQL-based API integration through the Shopify Storefront API  
- Building scalable folder structures and clean, responsive UI components  
- Improving understanding of eCommerce architecture by benchmarking a real-world product

Although I have not yet worked with Shopify Liquid or NestJS, this project reflects my active effort to bridge those gaps through real-world practice and hands-on development.
